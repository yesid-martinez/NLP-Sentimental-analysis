uczv5QC-Tuo,Will China&#39;s DeepSeek burst the American AI bubble? | DW News Desk,"So frustrating‚Äîthe lack of understanding from people! DeepSeek‚Äôs achievements are nowhere near those of other AI companies. DeepSeek cannot exist without models like OpenAI‚Äôs. They rely on distilling or using an existing model to train their own. DeepSeek‚Äôs achievements are not the same as those of companies building frontier models; they focused on optimization and leveraging others‚Äô models, not creating the foundational AI infrastructure.

We still need OpenAI to spend billions on hardware to train these models so DeepSeek can then use their APIs or models to train theirs‚Äîof course, at a much lower cost. This is highly misleading. Microsoft and OpenAI have already stated they will implement methods to detect and block attempts to distill their models. Then what?

At the very least, the media should explain what DeepSeek actually did and how it has nothing to do with the AI infrastructure still needed to create frontier models. DeepSeek doesn‚Äôt really have an advantage‚Äîmost AI labs were focused on developing new features rather than optimization. That won‚Äôt happen again. Now, they will have no choice but to prioritize optimization.

This could have unintended consequences for open-source models like LLaMA, which spend billions in development, relying on adoption to justify the cost. Why should they continue spending billions if others just distill their models? Closed-source models can start blocking requests they detect as distillation attempts, and the U.S. could even impose restrictions on AI service traffic from China."
uczv5QC-Tuo,Will China&#39;s DeepSeek burst the American AI bubble? | DW News Desk,"That's the American model, overprice anything and everything, ask for any price in anything and you will see the obscene gap between the US and the rest of the world ,that's the American policy üòÇ"

-Jac4kFNd6U,Why Everyone In AI Is Freaking Out¬†About¬†DeepSeek?,"Liang Wenfeng the founder of DeepSeek is a graduate from Zhejiang University.
DeepSeek spent around $5 million to train its DeepSeek-R1 model, which is a fraction of the cost of training similar models by other companies. 
The company‚Äôs ability to build a competitive model at a lower cost has raised questions about the effectiveness of US export controls on high-end computer chips. 
DeepSeek‚Äôs engineers used only about 2,000 specialized computer chips from Nvidia, compared to the 16,000 chips needed by major American companies, to build their chatbot.
DeepSeek‚Äôs models are open-source, allowing the global AI community to benefit from their advancements.
Japan announced 500 billion dollar of cash injection while DeepSeek is making good without excessive money and not having the most advanced chips.
Trump announced a private sector investment of up to $500 billion to fund infrastructure for artificial intelligence, aiming to outpace rival nations in the business-critical technology.
While famous companies like Google, Microsoft and Meta from Facebook have been putting tens of billions of dollars into their AI operations, DeepSeek R1 is beating Western competition on multiple parameters.
DeepSeek made it transparent and open source with the code on the computer itself.
DeepSeek has made their findings a gift to the world and to the US where most AI research is done.
US government has spent three years playing dirty and bullying other countries to stop selling AI chips to China.
AI engineers are moving frantically to dissect and copy everything from DeepSeek.
DeepSeek‚Äôs achievements have sparked discussions about the global AI landscape, with some experts suggesting that 2025 could be the year of reinforcement learning."

1hHdbShywzc,Chinese Streets Exploding Randomly All Over China - DeepSeek Exposed - Episode #248,I haven't been on the Play store in a while. What I did notice is you can't really rate things anymore. It seems you can write but only if you get an app. I actually went to see if DeepSeek was actually number one. People are certainly singing its praises. Of course moronic people are still using apps like Temu to get a bunch of overrated garbage. So I'm not exactly surprised people are so dumb. It says that 10 million people have downloaded DeepSeek. I honestly do not understand the allure of AI except for a bunch of people are freaking lazy. I personally find it extremely dangerous. This shite can be trained by anyone to eventually make people believe what they want them to believe. It's not like it popped up one day and started teaching itself. I am concerned that history and facts are going to become even more distorted. I've noticed in the short sections of places like YouTube and Facebook recently that it's had a lot more AI. I've also noticed that the amount of paranoia and obvious propaganda made to make people paranoid has really amped up recently. People are spreading around fake videos like they're the gospel truth. It's making people even more paranoid than before. There was the crash in DC and there was a fake video going around of survivors. Now people think there's a cover up because not one time in the regular media were they talking about survivors. It's about as bad as the drones or all the fake videos coming out of California. This AI stuff is dangerous. People were already distrusting and paranoid and now it's becoming even worse because for some reason we've lost the damn ability to think of ourselves.

1hHdbShywzc,Chinese Streets Exploding Randomly All Over China - DeepSeek Exposed - Episode #248,"CCP and chinese elite are exploiting their own citizens. They talk about how bad Americans are and how they hate them, yet its the chinese working class and poorest class of people that they actually hate the most by the way they are treating them. Forced labour, forced labour camps, absolutely no social welfare, no health benefits, no insurance. Adults and even children work loooong hours without getting paid at all, or getting paid very little, sometimes in food rations, thats all. Its a modern slavery, and CCP keep preaching how great chinese communism is doing. its disgusting, painfull, depressing treatment of their own citizens. I dont understand, how far chinese people have to be pushed for them to say ENOUGH! and forcefully remove their government. When are they going to understand that CCP uses socialism as a cover for unfair, illegal and greedy enslavement of chinese people. allowing themselves to become very rich, sending their children to US to study, having the best of everything that poorer chinese class worked day and night for CCP to be able to have all that luxury. If I was chinese, I would risk everything and try to remove that government, instead of working my ass off for corrupt government. chinese people are over 1 billion, of which only about or less than 1% is government. you could rid of them in no time. and build a new one, a better one, the one thats bsed on  rule of law. socialism will never work, because socialism does not take in consideration the nature of a human being. people want things for themselves, people wnt to achieve things in all sorts of different ways including business, people want freedoms, to express themselves, to knowledge. freedom of religion.  people want to travel and explore without having to ask permission to their corrupt gov. people want to be free. that can only be achieved in a capitalistic country with fair constitution, allowing basic human freedoms. also a country that respects all living things, not only human beings.

1hHdbShywzc,Chinese Streets Exploding Randomly All Over China - DeepSeek Exposed - Episode #248,"are we really gonna be nitpicking about whether it's ""fair"" to call it ""Chinese New Year""? I didn't expect this kind of quibbling from you guys. people call it Chinese New Year because it was the Chinese who invented it. that doesn't imply it is only the modern PRC who celebrate it or should get credit for it. it just honors the contribution of the ancient Chinese people who invented it. and Taiwan? you mean the Republic of CHINA? the country founded by other descendants of the Han Chinese? when we call it Chinese New Year, we're crediting the Taiwanese too. it's not about nationality, it's about Chinese culture and ancestry. the Chinese New Year reached other neighboring countries through cultural diffusion, so even if Koreans practice it, and prefer to call it Lunar New Year, that doesn't oblige the whole world to refer to it as Lunar New Year.

culture is meant to be shared, so I have no problem with anyone borrowing elements of my culture (European), and indeed the whole world benefits from adopting thousands of things invented by Europeans, and we never demand credit. adoption is so thorough that most people don't even realize these things come from Europe. modern clothing, modern shoes, air conditioning, plumbing, computers, the Gregorian calendar, the dating system, you name it... all borrowed without credit, and that's fine. I don't expect people to call their shoes ""European shoes"" just because the design tradition comes from Europe. but one thing that does bother me is the way some modern academics use the terms C.E. and B.C.E. to refer to years. abbreviations for ""common era"" and ""before common era."" there's nothing wrong with the terms themselves. if they were used in the context of a new dating system, I'd have no problem with it. but they're not; they're used solely as replacements for the traditional terms A.D. and B.C., and indeed B.C.E. was chosen because of its similarity to B.C. (making it more self-explanatory). so it's the same dating system (the one that says we're in the year 2025 right now, the one whose year zero is set on the creators' best estimate for the birth year of Jesus), just with different markers.

it's just gross to steal an existing dating system, invented by the Catholic Church for the glory of God and adopted across the Christian world, and then continue using it, but scrub all the Christian stuff out of it. and of course the introduction of these terms was precipitated and accompanied by criticism of the original terms A.D. and B.C. for their connection to religion. if you're gonna borrow someone else's culture, that's fine. but to be all prissy about the terminology is such a disrespect. it's like someone invites you into their home, and the first thing you do is criticize the interior decoration, and start remodeling things. only it's worse, since they keep using these new terms in such immense volumes that it crowds out the original terms. so the creators of the dating system have been effectively scrubbed from their own discourse, by scholars no less, in scholarly disciplines that they started in the first place. the least you can do is pay homage to the culture whose dating system you're borrowing. and of course I'm not alone in this assessment. even Neil DeGrasse Tyson, one of the most famous advocates for atheism in the world, agrees with me that if you're gonna use the dating system, you shouldn't scrub its authors' culture from it. it's just not classy.

so I'd say the same thing applies to Chinese New Year. it's not as extreme an example, so I wouldn't insist that anyone call it Chinese New Year. but for them to insist that everybody else _stop_ calling it Chinese New Year, in favor of a name that doesn't pay homage to its creators, is disrespectful and ridiculous. as for other lunar new year celebrations, you can call them whatever you want. not every lunar new year celebration is the same thing. Chinese New Year is based on the Chinese calendar. other Sinicized cultures also celebrate the same thing, based on the same (Chinese) calendar. on the other hand, other cultures celebrate something similar, but culturally independent, based on an indigenous calendar. so it's possible for multiple cultures to independently invent a lunar new year celebration, and when we say ""happy Chinese New Year,"" we aren't referring to all of them collectively. we're referring to the celebration that's based on the traditional Chinese calendar, which is quite distinct from the calendars of other cultures that also have a lunar new year celebration."

1hHdbShywzc,Chinese Streets Exploding Randomly All Over China - DeepSeek Exposed - Episode #248,"01:42:55 ... Each The China Show seems to have moments where the slides either take too long to load or load before they should.
Wouldn't an old-school powerpoint type of slide system be better where all Winston has to do is press the right arrow to move to the next slide and the left arrow to reverse a slide?
Don't get me wrong, I an trying to be true, but there shouldn't be problems with slides moving too fast or waiting too long to flip to the next one. Using Powerpoint-like presentations for a video is fine, but having it programmed to be on a timer or whatnot just doesn't seem to work all that great. Putting it onto a regular slideshow program where you have total control over when they flip as well as previews of each slide so you know exactly where to go when trying to find something you showed five minutes ago, there would be no hunting for.
I just think whatever slideshow program you're using now is too complicated for what you need. Go back to basic slideshow formats like Powerpoint and The China Show would be polished slick and shiny with no disorder or confusion as to if a slide had been included or not."

This product is time sensitive and needs to pass through multiple nations quarantine procedures so they probably have diplomatic immunity.

1hHdbShywzc,Chinese Streets Exploding Randomly All Over China - DeepSeek Exposed - Episode #248,"Deepseek is basically China throwing a wrench into AI after being quietly unable to catch up for the past several years. 

It makes a lot of sense when considering that it could be a distilled model or stolen model of existing AI. 
It barely beats out existing benchmarks and was done in a relatively short period of time. Unless they have some industry breaking tech, which as open source shows it doesn't, it being a model based off of existing models or being a hastily tuned copy of existing model is the most likely scenario.
(If you look into it a bit you'll realize this is exactly what it is.) 

Deepseek could not exist had it not been for other AI models paving its path.

It's a great political move as there has been a lot of negative public sentiment built up due to OpenAI monopolizing AI tech and data, which is a strategy that is very typical of the CCP."

1hHdbShywzc,Chinese Streets Exploding Randomly All Over China - DeepSeek Exposed - Episode #248,"Chinese parents are so irresponsible that it makes me angry. It‚Äôs no wonder they get trafficked.

I once came across a little girl, maybe 4 years old, all alone and crying. No adult in sight.

She didn‚Äôt speak English, so i called my Chinese friend to speak to her and maybe help figure out which floor she was supposed to be on to help reunite her with her parents.

My Chinese friend refused to help. Said abandoning their children temporarily like this is something parents do to their children to punish them. I was like what?

Upon investigation, she does it as well. I asked the obvious question any person would ask. ‚ÄúWhat if something happens to her? Kidnap, child molester, etc?‚Äù

She said don‚Äôt worry so much, there‚Äôs CCTV

I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I said what! I‚Äôve been alone with this little girl for 10 minutes now. And she was out here longer than that. Nobody has been around.  Do you realize what an evil person could have done to her in that time. 

I said maybe CCTV might help identify the devil who harms her, but maybe they will be far far away from here before anyone realizes they need to check the CCTV.

Even if you catch the guy, even a death sentence won‚Äôt undo the permanent damage an evil person could cause this child in 15 minutes.

I left it there. I don‚Äôt normally go around trying to attack and change other people‚Äôs cultures, but i hope despite her outward attitude towards what i was saying, that she went home and thought about it.

(I‚Äôm not a psychologist, so I don‚Äôt even know how what kind of harm it does to a child when parents abandon them like that whenever they‚Äôre naughty. But it can‚Äôt be good.)

2) Procure the AI chips, the GPU, the DRAM, the 2nm AI chips. Some countries are sanctioned by the USA, scientists have to reinvent the wheel. In Deepseek, the scientists procure low end Nvidia chips and work around the modelling. Yes, it works. By utilising low end Nvidia AI chips and a tight budget, CEO Liang reinvented the wheel.
3) Human resources, AI scientists and engineers. China has 5 million STEM graduates per year, the USA 1 million. In AI, both quantity and quality of STEM graduates are vital.
4) 1.6nm 2.0nm and 3.0nm AI Chips. Both US and China do not have 1.6nm and 2.0nm AI chips. Huawei SMIC and Hua Hong have 5nm AI chips. The Chinese chip manufacturers are designing 3nm AI chips this year. The US has funded the Chips Act 2023 $50 billion, to relocate some companies to USA.

Something like this happened during the cold war where the USSR did not have access to high power computers and particularly RAM memory.

""The real value of AI isn‚Äôt in endless debates over who built the best model‚Äîit‚Äôs in what we do with it to solve real-world problems.

Now that DeepSeek has gone open-source, it adds to the global AI ecosystem, allowing researchers, developers, and businesses to build on top of it. That benefits everyone, much like how Linux, Wikipedia, and the internet itself have thrived through openness and collaboration.

At the end of the day, competition should be about applications and impact:

Medical breakthroughs ‚Äì AI-assisted drug discovery, early disease detection, personalized treatment plans.
Scientific progress ‚Äì AI-powered simulations, climate modeling, materials discovery.
Education & accessibility ‚Äì Free AI tutors, real-time language translation, making knowledge universally accessible.
Automation & efficiency ‚Äì Smarter logistics, energy optimization, and AI-driven research tools.
Focusing on practical solutions instead of gatekeeping AI technology is how humanity actually moves forward. If China, the U.S., and the rest of the world compete on AI-driven solutions rather than hoarding AI itself, we all win.""

We are at the beginning of the AI revolution. It's sti in its infancy.

Those steps will enable the synergy to perform vast numbers of tasks impossible today in every field.

Li-Iei43pgs,Deep dive into DeepSeek: China&#39;s accidental AI powerhouse?,"Lei, sometimes its not about Nation or Ideology.   China, this time, just had a very smart engineer who was able to direct the program his way.  Really, all the Silicon Valley Projects had the same access to Chat GP Open AI, and their models were clunky and expensive compared to Deep Seek.  One of the videos I  watched says that it was the result of the Chinese designing a more efficient Computer Architecture, that because the Final End, the Predictive End of a AI System has accuracies that can be no better than the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, that is is a waste of good chips and a lot of power to build the Predictive End with the same hardware as the front end.  The American's didn't care because their investers gave them billions of dollars and they  couldn't figure out how to pocket all that money without just buying hardware from each other... they  just wanted to spend all the money so they wouldn't have to give any of it back. And so they built AI systems that could give a Measurement Resolution better than what an AI System is even capable of.   The Silicon Billionaires have been questioned about this, and they said they will economize like that later, but for now, they were just pulling circuits off the rack to build as quickly as possible.   The Chinese, who didn't already have built up  circuits were lucky to be able to think with a clean slate.   But yeah, the Chinese probably judged a few expenses to keep the numbers low, but who doesn't think that the Americans would be fudging the numbers too.   Lei, yeah, drag China through the mud when they deserve it, but this time it was a Chinese Engineering Team, you know, just Guys trying their best at the jobs they have to do, and they were able to Take all those Sissy Proud as Devil Silicon Billionaires and rub their faces in their own crap, and they did it with Engineering Genius.

Li-Iei43pgs,Deep dive into DeepSeek: China&#39;s accidental AI powerhouse?,"Once again, I think we might be over analyzing the DeepSeek situation. If DeepSeek parent company has already acquired large amount of A100 GPU to begin with it is unnecessary for them to have to acquire the a lot of H100 to achieve what DeepSeek need for their current model development. So whether if they might somehow acquired some additional H100 GPU or not is an irrelevant question.

When DeepSeek founder started amassing all of those GPUs back then, China and Chinese companies were not sanction by the US. Therefore, there is no reason or need for him or whoever might be backing him, like the CCP, to try to cover that up in acquiring those cards to begin with. Secondly, if forming the advanced AI development company was their primary goal from the beginning, there would never have been any idle GPU time and started maximizing their usage from the start.

 I think the founder of DeepSeek was more likely overly ambitious in trying to use more GPUs to do his algorithm and development trading. Large part of his algorithm trading did required the use of AI, so he did plan on doing some AI development from the start; just not necessary in the LLM AI development. After acquiring the large number of GPUs and only later found out that he has a lot of idle GPU hours, that's when he was trying to maximize his investment into LLM AI development because ChatGPT just started to blow up around the world.

All of the other Chinese company like Alibaba's recent announcements are nothing more than trying to ride on the coat tail of DeepSeek's recent success. Qwen 2.5 has been out for awhile and has always been quite good. Alibaba's latest announcement of Qwen 2.5 Max sound like they simply increasing the maximum context length allowed for their model rather than anything else fundamental with Qwen 2.5 since they didn't bother increasing the version number of the release.

All of these are more of a demonstration of capitalism rather than communism. To think that CCP has planned all of these in advance and managed to develop the sophisticated AI development successfully that rivals the US market would be giving the CCP way too much credit. Any technical development planned and funded by the CCP generally results in specular failure due to their incompetence and corruption within the government.

Unfortunately, with the large success of DeepSeek's recent development gaining such worldwide attention, I am sure CCP will be draping all over DeepSeek from this point forward. I am not sure how this impact their future development going forward. All I know is once CCP gets heavily involved, the development will also generally head south down the tube for the worst. I think this is could be an unfortunate turn of event for DeepSeek by gaining all of these unwanted attention. I hope they will continue to develop and release more advanced AI model and continue to publish more paper. We will have to see."

Li-Iei43pgs,Deep dive into DeepSeek: China&#39;s accidental AI powerhouse?,"Well done covering this. I know a bit about this topic. I did a deep dive on this issue, maybe this can help explain some things.

DeepSeek data-scraped OpenAI using a method called distillation. While OpenAI and other AI companies hoard data then process it, which takes years of time and billions of dollars to create a mathematical representation of the world, DeepSeek created thousands of bot GPT accounts and farmed the output data from Chat GPT.

So for example, GPT doesn't know what 2+2 is. From data collected, it determines that the answer is 4, with a high degree of probability. The probability or accuracy, is determined by the quantity of data their hardware has crunched. It essentially has memorized answers based on the probability of it being right.

So what DeepSeek did, is it asked millions of questions to GPT and stole its responses as facts and then built a database of those answers. As a result, it answers exactly the same as ChatGPT--in fact, it's a clone! 

DeepSeek cloned ChatGPT, quite accurately. So they don't need huge data processing to figure out which answers are most probable--it just steals GPT's answers and requires no processing.

An analogy would be this: A chef spent 20 years making this perfect recipe, spent his life and education refining his craft. Then Bob the chef comes in and steals the recipe and reproduces the same thing.

But the thing is, Bob can't improve it because bob doesn't really understand it. So that's what DeepSeek Faces. It cannot evolve--the best it will ever be is what it cloned, which is GPT o1 model. Because their development relies on stealing data, as soon as these AI companies lock this method down, they will never get any better.

So, essentially, DeepSeek will fail to evolve and will only be relevant for the next 6 months or so. It will soon be out-dated and unable to continue cloning for advancement. 

So they will enjoy the limelight while they can, and they'll be stuck at o1 model performance forever more. 

Quite an interesting drama though!"

Now that DeepSeek has gone open-source, it adds to the global AI ecosystem, allowing researchers, developers, and businesses to build on top of it. That benefits everyone, much like how Linux, Wikipedia, and the internet itself have thrived through openness and collaboration.

At the end of the day, competition should be about applications and impact:

Medical breakthroughs ‚Äì AI-assisted drug discovery, early disease detection, personalized treatment plans.
Scientific progress ‚Äì AI-powered simulations, climate modeling, materials discovery.
Education & accessibility ‚Äì Free AI tutors, real-time language translation, making knowledge universally accessible.
Automation & efficiency ‚Äì Smarter logistics, energy optimization, and AI-driven research tools.
Focusing on practical solutions instead of gatekeeping AI technology is how humanity actually moves forward. If China, the U.S., and the rest of the world compete on AI-driven solutions rather than hoarding AI itself, we all win.""

We are at the beginning of the AI revolution. It's sti in its infancy. Not only are far more advanced concepts, hardrware and software necessary but it will be required to marry AI to quantum computing and robotics to exploit its full potential. Those steps will enable the synergy to perform vast numbers of tasks impossible today in every field. Because of the immense power this will create the US might consider monopolizing the techmologies banning exports and classifying them as military secrets.

Li-Iei43pgs,Deep dive into DeepSeek: China&#39;s accidental AI powerhouse?,"Lei, sometimes its not about Nation or Ideology.   China, this time, just had a very smart engineer who was able to direct the program his way.  Really, all the Silicon Valley Projects had the same access to Chat GP Open AI, and their models were clunky and expensive compared to Deep Seek.  One of the videos I  watched says that it was the result of the Chinese designing a more efficient Computer Architecture, that because the Final End, the Predictive End of a AI System has accuracies that can be no better than the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, that is is a waste of good chips and a lot of power to build the Predictive End with the same hardware as the front end.  The American's didn't care because their investers gave them billions of dollars and they  couldn't figure out how to pocket all that money without just buying hardware from each other... they  just wanted to spend all the money so they wouldn't have to give any of it back. And so they built AI systems that could give a Measurement Resolution better than what an AI System is even capable of.   The Silicon Billionaires have been questioned about this, and they said they will economize like that later, but for now, they were just pulling circuits off the rack to build as quickly as possible.   The Chinese, who didn't already have built up  circuits were lucky to be able to think with a clean slate.   But yeah, the Chinese probably judged a few expenses to keep the numbers low, but who doesn't think that the Americans would be fudging the numbers too.   Lei, yeah, drag China through the mud when they deserve it, but this time it was a Chinese Engineering Team, you know, just Guys trying their best at the jobs they have to do, and they were able to Take all those Sissy Proud as Devil Silicon Billionaires and rub their faces in their own crap, and they did it with Engineering Genius.

Li-Iei43pgs,Deep dive into DeepSeek: China&#39;s accidental AI powerhouse?,"Indeed it‚Äôs accidental, considering vast majority of population is under famines"
Li-Iei43pgs,Deep dive into DeepSeek: China&#39;s accidental AI powerhouse?,"Once again, I think we might be over analyzing the DeepSeek situation. If DeepSeek parent company has already acquired large amount of A100 GPU to begin with it is unnecessary for them to have to acquire the a lot of H100 to achieve what DeepSeek need for their current model development. So whether if they might somehow acquired some additional H100 GPU or not is an irrelevant question.

When DeepSeek founder started amassing all of those GPUs back then, China and Chinese companies were not sanction by the US. Therefore, there is no reason or need for him or whoever might be backing him, like the CCP, to try to cover that up in acquiring those cards to begin with. Secondly, if forming the advanced AI development company was their primary goal from the beginning, there would never have been any idle GPU time and started maximizing their usage from the start.

 I think the founder of DeepSeek was more likely overly ambitious in trying to use more GPUs to do his algorithm and development trading. Large part of his algorithm trading did required the use of AI, so he did plan on doing some AI development from the start; just not necessary in the LLM AI development. After acquiring the large number of GPUs and only later found out that he has a lot of idle GPU hours, that's when he was trying to maximize his investment into LLM AI development because ChatGPT just started to blow up around the world.

All of the other Chinese company like Alibaba's recent announcements are nothing more than trying to ride on the coat tail of DeepSeek's recent success. Qwen 2.5 has been out for awhile and has always been quite good. Alibaba's latest announcement of Qwen 2.5 Max sound like they simply increasing the maximum context length allowed for their model rather than anything else fundamental with Qwen 2.5 since they didn't bother increasing the version number of the release.

All of these are more of a demonstration of capitalism rather than communism. To think that CCP has planned all of these in advance and managed to develop the sophisticated AI development successfully that rivals the US market would be giving the CCP way too much credit. Any technical development planned and funded by the CCP generally results in specular failure due to their incompetence and corruption within the government.

Unfortunately, with the large success of DeepSeek's recent development gaining such worldwide attention, I am sure CCP will be draping all over DeepSeek from this point forward. I am not sure how this impact their future development going forward. All I know is once CCP gets heavily involved, the development will also generally head south down the tube for the worst. I think this is could be an unfortunate turn of event for DeepSeek by gaining all of these unwanted attention. I hope they will continue to develop and release more advanced AI model and continue to publish more paper. We will have to see."

Li-Iei43pgs,Deep dive into DeepSeek: China&#39;s accidental AI powerhouse?,"Well done covering this. I know a bit about this topic. I did a deep dive on this issue, maybe this can help explain some things.

DeepSeek data-scraped OpenAI using a method called distillation. While OpenAI and other AI companies hoard data then process it, which takes years of time and billions of dollars to create a mathematical representation of the world, DeepSeek created thousands of bot GPT accounts and farmed the output data from Chat GPT.

So for example, GPT doesn't know what 2+2 is. From data collected, it determines that the answer is 4, with a high degree of probability. The probability or accuracy, is determined by the quantity of data their hardware has crunched. It essentially has memorized answers based on the probability of it being right.

So what DeepSeek did, is it asked millions of questions to GPT and stole its responses as facts and then built a database of those answers. As a result, it answers exactly the same as ChatGPT--in fact, it's a clone! 

DeepSeek cloned ChatGPT, quite accurately. So they don't need huge data processing to figure out which answers are most probable--it just steals GPT's answers and requires no processing.

An analogy would be this: A chef spent 20 years making this perfect recipe, spent his life and education refining his craft. Then Bob the chef comes in and steals the recipe and reproduces the same thing.

But the thing is, Bob can't improve it because bob doesn't really understand it. So that's what DeepSeek Faces. It cannot evolve--the best it will ever be is what it cloned, which is GPT o1 model. Because their development relies on stealing data, as soon as these AI companies lock this method down, they will never get any better.

So, essentially, DeepSeek will fail to evolve and will only be relevant for the next 6 months or so. It will soon be out-dated and unable to continue cloning for advancement. 

So they will enjoy the limelight while they can, and they'll be stuck at o1 model performance forever more. 

Quite an interesting drama though!"

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"5:03 No. Deepseek seems to have exfiltrated openai's model weights, sort of. It seems to have used openai's model to train (student/teacher) little tiny models and put them together in a MOE (mixture of experts) model. So it is a sort of distillation of openai's model. It doesnt totally call the moat into question, but it calls into question their ability to keep their models from getting stolen, so, sort of. The real threat to the ai bubble is that the hype is threatened. The myth that this is ""intelligent"" at all is wearing thinner. Its a database with a compression/deconpression loading/query algo that takes advantage of a statistical model of the data. It has a lot of amazing use cases, but its not ""AI"" in the way most people are taking that term and some sort of superintelligence is not about to wake up. That part is just an illusion.

I haven‚Äôt had a ‚Äújob‚Äù for most of my 70 years, yet I have always created value and monetized it. We have passed through the industrial and postindustrial stage of capital and labor and are adjusting to a new paradigm. Policy always lags far behind."

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"It is really simple to understand why Chinese AI is a lot cheaper, and more effective,  at least, in the Chinese language domain. Chinese researchers and engineers focus on model and logic backed up by vast amounts of data, while the U.S. counterparts rely heavily on chips capacity and capabilities for computing. There is far more human intelligence involved in Deep Seek than ChatGTP. Human intelligence is lot cheaper and efficient and effective than hardware. The Western media pretend not to understand this simple fact because they don‚Äôt know how to compete with China and they don‚Äôt know how to deal with the consequences in the human intelligence domain."
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"I‚Äôm not saying that very clever boffins can‚Äôt suddenly discover a novel software shortcut to an established problem, nvidia boffins recently did exactly that with ray tracing, but this is China we are talking about guys‚Ä¶ a proven state lier and trickster. It amazes me how quickly we want to believe something when it fits to our existing anxieties. Everyone has become so titchy concerning the high price of the tech stocks, that they would swallow anything that was a potential black swan. This model could have easily been created by China with a larger cluster of less-powerful processors over a longer period of time. They could have leveraged existing A.I. models to train their own. Until we know for sure, I would take the claims of DeepSeek with a large pinch of salt."

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"I don't agree with the assessment that DeepSeek will change the entire AI market. Yes, they have chosen a new approach that produces acceptable results with less high precision of the floating point numbers, but they still have the disadvantage of lower computing power. The US AI companies can adapt the new technology and scale it to their data centers, which increases their lead again. Its just temporary."

I can't tell you how happy I was to hear you mention Charles as a long time mentor and do hope you can coax him to appear more frequently as a guest on Thoughtful Money.

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,No it will not. I don't think we truly realize how deeply people are bought into the idea that stocks are always going to go up. This will end in crisis not a crash. Markets will keep pushing till something breaks. The Fed has changed investor psychology. No one fears stock price fall. It is now just a buying opportunity.
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,Open AI is done. Deepseek is the future.

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"Deepseek cost 6 million, the original GPT cost 18 million. so the gap is not as big as it seems. it is just that we assume better model MUST cost more to developed. and that is now proven false."

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"Adam, I'm one of your substack subscribers and I normally love your content. But this video is just so off, I couldn't finish it. 

1. Sure, this might impact open AI's subscription model. But it's not going to do anything to all the products like Office, Photoshop, etc. The models are integrated into those products and make using those products SIGNIFICANTLY more powerful. That's (presumably) where those companies derive their valuation from.

2. Just cause software is more efficient doesn't mean the hardware is going to become obsolete. It means they're going to push the software to even greater extremes on better hardware. All the AI companies are incorporating deepseek's methods into their own models. 

3. Some of these AI companies are unique in the data they're able to train their data on. Deepseek will never have access to the entire trove of imagery and PDFs that Adobe has or all the documents that MS Office has to train their models.

4. Anything China is releasing should be taken with a grain of salt. The mobile app is already being shown to be a huge invasion of privacy (TikTok anyone?). I wouldn't be surprised if there is some ulterior motive going on. 

Please bring on experts that are actually in the AI industry and not just observing the AI industry."

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"51:45 The idea that other countries don't have ""as strong ethics controls as we do"" is laughable. The US is the leader in unethical behavior, allowing, as Charles Hugh Smith said, society to be controlled by the economy and the economy to be controlled by finance. 
The EU has tried to erect barriers against the destructive power of money in the hands of the few and the thugs, with restrictions on violation of privacy, stealing and selling of sensitive personal data, and online surveillance with the sole goal of profit. And yet Americans are up in arms against those backward Europeans who ""stifle innovation"" (the number one bullshit excuse for the devastation of OUR society and the return to Medieval levels of wealth inequality.) And, once again, we, the non-powerful with delusion of relevance, will end up paying the full price of the latest version of American madness."

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"It is very interesting that so many are sweating the effect of AI on jobs. We need to be reminded that when computers and the internet came along there was the same concern. People were going to be able to do many things online that they couldn't before. What happened? Consumers and businesses were able to go online to do many things that they coud not do before. The result was that consumers and businesses were able to make better use of their time and money than they werre able to before. Competition in the services industry increased, and prices came down for that which was effected by internet seach and shop. All kinds of services popped up that were not there before. The same for products. Imports included. The result was an expanded much more efficient goods and services. AI will have the same impact. It will make consumers and businesses much better off and new businesses and innovations will pop up everywhere that can take advantage of the new technology, and people will get jobs that never existed before!

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"(To coattail on what Charles is saying around min. 27 - exactly, well said) This won't be the last evolution to challenge hardware efficiency - Chinese or U.S. These AI tides are still working off B2B dollars and have yet to prove any significant D2C marketing (sans OpenAI) that shows any real value in that space. While this remains, news flashes like this will make blue chips feel like the Russell 1000 (especially with a US/China tug-of-war) because we're still heavily investing solely on future investment potential and the P/E ratios prove it. To make matters more complicated, it's the first tech era that significantly aims at reducing jobs, which again helps business balances sheets but not from consumer activity."

Excellent!!

Nate"
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,Loved this interview with Charles Hugh Smith ! Thank you Adam ‚Ä¶ more interviews like this please ‚Ä¶. So insightful üòä
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,Who is out there using X.  That sounds like agross porn site.  Bluesky is the shit.
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"We have a tendency to underestimate foreign competitors especially Chinese & Russians.  While we have content creators making garbage, they are graduating smart disciplined stem professionals. The ‚Äúbarbarians are at the gait & they‚Äôre coming in!"
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"Maybe this will make the US understand that the Chinese are really competent.
There's no way the US will have a monopoly on AI and robotics.
It's not that the US attempts to surpress China's technology anyway they can doesn't creates problems for them.
More that it inspires them to work harder to overcome those.
It will take years for AI to get to a plateau. Meanwhile it's not hardware limited, but the architecture isn't complete yet.
It won't be anyway near complete before China has its own Nvidia and EUV litography. So what the US does to stymize China's development won't really stop them. It will inspire them! They will have a lot to put into their hardware when the dam bursts!

The fact that China has substantially more STEM graduates than the US has (including the Indians üôÇ) will assure that they don't lag  behind the USA.
They are also getting really good universities. The US MIT, Stanford, etc, are good. But they don't get the brightest Chinese students anymore.
And that, I think,  will have an effect!"
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,How much money did DeepSeek make shorting US tech stocks? The CEO of DeepSeek was a very successful hedge fund manager so I would assume he had some inkling as to the movement of stock prices once they made their announcement.
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"Adam, your timing on this content is impeccable"

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,Is there really any reason to believe their cost and chip accounting.
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"This is just a question in my mind about the inefficiency of AI. Most of what we what it to do is specialized work. It is nice that it can do more innovative stuff, but those are not our primary objectives. We want it to do stuff recognition, so that a cctv video becomes easily processable information. E.g. instead of raw images of cars passing by a traffic light, we want car model and license plate information, which can be used to confirm legitimacy of the insurance on the vehicle. Instead of storing GB videos, we store 1kb information about each intersections, allowing us to create useful big data. All these shouldn't be CPU intensive, except the stuff recognition part."
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,Excellent. Love Charles too. Please keep doing this format. Very valuable

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,Adam appreciate for the valuable work. Why do you keep repeating what the guest is saying ? It feels like a loop and extends the video lenght 20 minutes
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"OpenAI even said over a year ago, that they don't really have as much of a moat of people think. Also DeepSeek runs on nVidia, so weird that it should be seen as a threat to nVidia."

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,What the market has not considered is Jevons paradox.  The paradox States that d as the price drops because of increased efficiency. The total addressable market or Tam increases thus increasing the profit of the companies who mine for coal or companies who distribute AI products such as the Blackwell and the Reuben chips.   Expect NVDA Stock to rise and PLTR stock to rise!   üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆ
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,There is no change from this model. The Jevons Paradox ensures that even if the task gets easier the demand for compute will not decline. These talking heads are wrong. This does nothing to NVDA or other hardware vendors. It might harm OpenAI.
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,How about a 30 hour work week?
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"NVDA lost around $600 Billion today. If the AI stock bubble is burst, the market is set to lose trillions and will impact all the magnificient seven. The Mag. seven market cap is $17.6 trillion. AI & LLMs destroy the business case for cloud (as explained by MS CEO in many interviews), cloud is the profit center for most of the Mag. seven."

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"Awesome report!  At the moment, on the fly.  I like it."
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"Going to ask a few of the obvious questions.

If China found a way around hardware with the use of software alone, why was China upset about being shut out of the high-speed AI chip marke with sancions?

Secondly, if China can only advance because they are IP thieves and not themselves innovators, where did this come from?  Definitely not from some single Chinese entrepreneur or even a small group.  If this is truly a worable solution to hardware, it has state sponsored money thrown at it...and a lot of it.  And if that is the case, do you really want to use it without having every single line of code verified to ensure there is not a technological repeat of the Wuhan virus!"
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,Great job! I was surprised to see this topic addressed so soon. Go Thoughtful Money!

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,(Monopolistic) Manifesting replaced manufacturing. Real AI should destroy profits and monopolies. Social networks should bring direct democracy.
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"As a Brit I understand this approach. Since WWII we have had to try and keep up with technology, but always on a shoestring budget.The jet engine is a good example, with the first one made in Whittles shed, with cornflake boxes, a bit of string, and some gorilla glue !!üòÇ"
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"Great discussion - very grounded conversation. You are wrong in a couple of related areas IMHO:

First you say, or Charles said. that automation cannot do all human jobs. Well that will be less and less true over time, so the need for realistic UBI discussions is now - the matter will take years to organise, and in that time many will suffer needlessly. (And I agree with Charles that taxing tech companies is not a long term solution)

The second issue I have is with the timing of automation having an impact. It is not just now, in fact automation has driven the mag-7 companies for nearly 20-years, and although they didn‚Äôt ‚Äòdisplace‚Äô human labour, they prevailed because they didn‚Äôt ‚Äòneed‚Äô human labour in the first place‚Ä¶"

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"The markets love to have a speculative narrative to run wild with.  In 2020 during Covid, Crypto was going to revolutionize the world!  Greyscale ran it's dump gold campaign, Elon backed BTC, etc.  Crypto never revolutionized the world.  That then moved into NVDA pimping the metaverse.  NFT's, Banksy, FAcebook became META, ...real esate in the meta verse went wild, etc., etc.  That never fully materialized. Then Chat GPT came out.....and NVDA shifted from Metaverse to AI infrastructure....now we can plagiarize, cheat on homework and work presentations, and create Fake News.  And still nobody has viable real ROI ideas for AI, besides automating basic jobs.  We have too much money in the system, creating speculative frenzies for ideas that are not well thought out....What's the next frenzie going to be about?...."

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,It's kind of like Bitcoin and xrp Bitcoin does transactions at the speed of 5 to 10 minutes when xrp does it within 4 to 6 seconds.

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,All that US AI developers do is buy back stock and pump up AI stocks no R&D we are 10 years behind China.  Guess that's what you get when your worried about gender DEI and ESG.

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"Great discussion, I think it's awesome when it's literally this timely! I didn't expect anybody to have any incredible clairvoyant revelations, but I do think that talking over the playing field and what's going on is important because some of us are brand new to some of these things."
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"In a nutshell, Deep Seek is how Nvidia treats gaming with regards to their software driver suite and a handful of generative AI are AMD. One uses elegance and the other uses brute force. Coincidentally, now both are attempting to use elegance, so this actually might just shift capex away from chips and towards elegant software solutions to maximize use of the abundance of hardware they already have.

By the way, this isn't anything new within technology. As a network engineer, I've witnessed this with the software virtualization of what were previous hardware ASAs, routers, switches, servers into VMs, etc. This is the typical natural cycle of technology and is also why semiconductors (I think Fred Hickey alluded to this) trade more like commodities and go through these violent cycles during early adoption periods."
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"Deepseek is not new.  It's been out and in the media since December!  CNBC has had numerous reports on it.  Other than the fact that it shot to the top of the app stores charts this past weekend, I don't know why the market is so late to react to this?"

My thought:  Any computing that produces an answer is AI.  What we have now is just the most recent idea of advanced computing that has caught att'n for grown man-children to latch onto as a reason to dump their money into something.... It's Dotcom all over again... It will be the future...but, not yet...and not for as much profit (as you guys pointed out)"
nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"I feel like an aspect of this we are missing or not discussing, maybe its irrelevant, but our willingness in the west to just trust Chinese tech and ignore the American (western) fear propaganda about China farming our info. Firstly America lied about TikTok and the fear mongering narratives around it being spy tech, but it was about not being able to control the narratives, when the genocide in Palestine started it became a huge problem, so we went to Red Note, and now again Deep Seek. Chinese are gaining trust and strength and nobody trusts the American propaganda its almost the complete opposite when they say something you know they are lying."

This is akin to claiming some dodgy Chinese S/W can make your phone render graphics better than an RTX5090. China's desperate to inflate their dying markets with snake oil claims as usual. The timing, just ahead of FOMC meeting and earnings, looks staged for maximum effect. I bought my first lot of 2 year leaps today on NVDA and ready to add all the way to $50 a share.

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"Here's my take.

Release this for everyone to use and disrupt this market.. which would destabilize the US economy. 

Behind the scenes, they continue to use and develop the more power hungry ""brute force"" style AI. 




Meanwhile, have some crazy hidden code in this open source software that allows China to shut down all duture AI based on this method...say 10-15 years from now.. in essence, have the capabilty to take down all other nations AI and leave them back to today's technology  but 10-15 years from now..

They always play the long game."

Especially after the Tik Tok-banning, tariff-threatening, chest-beating posturing of (mainly) the US.

One has to say the Chinese won this round -- and in a thoughtful, classy way to boot. Unlike the way the West has treated them lately. 

It also puts paid (literally and appropriately) to the monopolistic, mega-expensive, and mega energy-intensive methodology followed by the mega IT corporations that dominate the global economy.

nLOvJ9alKGM,SPECIAL REPORT: Did China&#39;s DeepSeek Just Pop The AI Stock Bubble? | Charles Hugh Smith,"37:00 - I sincerely doubt that AI researchers around the world were not aware of the approaches used in DeepSeek. Rather, I imagine they dismissed those approaches or ruled them out for specific reasons that most lay people would not be able to understand. Perhaps it was willful ignorance because of the vested interest in the huge revenue associated with less efficient approaches, or perhaps because of awareness of real risks to using the shortcuts that we have not yet heard about and that may detract from the promise of DeepSeek. Right now, there seem to be a lot of non-specialist pundits who are jumping on the reporting bandwagon, and in days to come we may hear more sobering technical assessments of the approach from experts who may not regard it as so Earth-shattering."

Good work. On the other hand, clearly Big Tech can't compete with the Chinese because all input costs are 10-50X cheaper in China. And their workers on average are far smarter and more capable than the H!B crap we hire from other places. Of course, the result is a big difference. Also, China's one party setup obviously a blessing for business. I suspect that they're gonna need to reconfigure ours first before they take us to war with China.

China&#39;s DeepSeek vs OpenAI, Nvidia Collapse, Trump ETF, &amp; Bitcoin","Predicting inflation starting to rise again this quarter while leading indicators showing economy slowing (not to mention governm*nt figures pumped up during the election). Global economy very weak which affects US. Fed dropping rates 0.50 shows they're VERY worried about financial downturn/crisis. interest rates coming down are also an indication banks are LESS willing to loan money into existence. The question here is where is the inflation going to come from in the near term? Consumers are mostly tapped out which is 70% of US economy (consumption). Yes inflation very likely to return but not before it continues to come down... Inflation can be a concern, but remember, certain assets like stocks  and Crypto‚Äôs acts as a hedge. Long & short-term trading is generally safer, allowing investors to weather market volatility. I have managed to grow a nest egg of around 2.2 B'tc to a decent 27B'tc in the space of a few months...

vpkZKsTd57M,"Stock Crash: Buying Opportunities? China&#39;s DeepSeek vs OpenAI, Nvidia Collapse, Trump ETF, &amp; Bitcoin","I think the  goal of DeepSeek is not to dominate or surpass competitors nor is it focused on direct competition. Instead, its mission is to push boundaries by democratizing how LLMs interact with hardware and optimize their operations (e.g. Hugging Face). This was more of a side project since their main drive is in the financial market algos.  Its open source nature benefits the entire ecosystem, including competitors, fostering collaboration and innovation. Similar to organizations like Red Hat, Canonical, or Apache,  it aims to provide a unique solution tailored to specific areas of the IT and AI industries. Nevertheless it recognizes that this initiative is not about displacing established leaders such as OpenAI, Nvidia, Grok, Anthropic, or Google's Gemini. Rather, it embraces the fact that we are still in the early stages of discovery within this revolutionary era of AI.  Plus its hard to have a trojan horse when you can use, modify, reconstruct you own LLMs from it."

vpkZKsTd57M,"Stock Crash: Buying Opportunities? China&#39;s DeepSeek vs OpenAI, Nvidia Collapse, Trump ETF, &amp; Bitcoin","If you think Deep Seek is disrupting the game just know there are at least 50-100 Chinese startups actively competing tooth and nail in foundational AI/LLM development with 10-20 who are considered major players (ie Baidu, Alibaba, Zhipu AI, Moonshot AI, etc). This sector is hyper-competitive in China at the moment, driven by national priorities, major venture capital funding, punitive chip sanctions, and the global AI race.  All of this has forced Chinese companies in the space to become ultra-efficient while innovating at breakneck speeds. They are now backed by a sea of funding from both private and govt-aligned investors. Adding to this they have access to a huge talent pool of gifted developers/engineers along with a population of 1.4 billion from which to source their AI training data. Rumor also swirling around that Deep Seek is running on domestically produced Huawei Ascend 920B chips which produced comparable benchmarks in performance to NVIDIA‚Äôs H100 but is 70% lower in cost. All signs point to this as just the beginning of whats to come out of that market.

With that being said those who haven‚Äôt traveled to China lately have no idea the types of tech advancements they are making there these days. You‚Äôre really doing yourself a disservice to be getting all your data on Chinese companies from western media sources. It‚Äôs no wonder you are feeling like you‚Äôre constantly being lied to."

No, China does not own the West Philippine Sea; according to a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, China does not have legal rights to the majority of the area claimed within its ""nine-dash line"" in the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, which is considered part of the Philippines' exclusive economic zone; China rejects this ruling and continues to assert its claims in the region. 
Key points about the dispute:
Philippine claim:
The Philippines asserts sovereignty over the West Philippine Sea based on its geographic proximity and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). 
China's ""nine-dash line"":
China claims most of the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, through a historical map depicting a ""nine-dash line"" which is not recognized by international law. 
2016 Arbitration Ruling:
A tribunal ruled in favor of the Philippines, stating that China's ""nine-dash line"" has no legal basis for claiming extensive maritime rights in the South China Sea. 
China's stance:
Despite the ruling, China continues to assert its claims and has engaged in activities like building artificial islands in the disputed areas.
